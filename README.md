# File Descriptions:
a. DT_maternal.ipynb:
- Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of Decision Trees for Maternal Health Risk prediction
- Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization
b. DT_churn.ipynb:
- Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of Decision Trees for Credit Card Churn prediction
- Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization
c. Niruthiha_Selvanayagam_002413183-DT-analysis.pdf:
- Comprehensive analysis report of the Decision Tree models
- Includes methodology, results interpretation, and conclusions for both Maternal Health Risk and Credit Card Churn predictions
# Running the Code:

Open the Jupyter notebooks (DT_maternal.ipynb and DT_churn.ipynb) using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
Run the cells in sequential order to reproduce the analysis

# Additional Information:
For a detailed analysis of the results and methodology, please refer to the Niruthiha_Selvanayagam_002413183-DT-analysis.pdf file. This report provides in-depth insights into the Decision Tree models used for both the Maternal Health Risk and Credit Card Churn predictions.
